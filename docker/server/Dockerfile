# This seemingly does about the same as github/gocd/gocd-docker(*) but 
# nowadays the script does a whole lot more.
#
# Most of all I think it is ~bad~ to hide provisioning inside Dockerfiles.
# The steps should be reusable in other environments too.  If you want to
# do the installation on bare metal, or in Vagrant, or whatever - then a
# bourne shell script(s) is more reusable.
#
# There are some special settings for this go-cd and yes, those additions
# could have been layered on top of for example the gocd/gocd-docker Docker
# image.  That would be quite nice. But see above :)
#
# Anyway, phusion baseimage seem to get it right with respect to an actual
# good base container, so let's start there.
